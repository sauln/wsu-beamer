# wsu-beamer
This is a Washington State University themed beamer template complete in crimson and grey and with a cougar head logo.

I've modified most of the default colors. If you find something that isn't in the color scheme, docs/Beamer-appearance-cheat-sheet.pdf should tell you what the name ofthat value is. 

If you make changes, please submit them back!

Thank you
